This post will tell you how to install NS-2.35 in Linux Mint 17.1 64-bit operating system.

NS-2 is a discrete event simulator targeted at networking research. NS-2 provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless (local and satellite) networks.

Step 1 : Download NS-2.35 from here(https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/)

Step 2 : Copy the downloaded file from the Download folder to your home directory /home/nabin folder ( in my case )

Step 3 : Open your Terminal and execute these commands one by one

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf libxmu-dev

Step 4 : Untar ns-allinone-2.35.tar.gz using the command below

tar zxvf ns-allinone-2.35.tar.gz

Step 5 : Once the file is unzipped, here you need to make a small change in the source file . Go to the folder ns-2.35/linkstate/ and open ls.h using any editor ( gedit or nano or vi). Now go to line number 137 and make the following changes

Just add this->; before erase

void eraseAll() { this->;erase(baseMap::begin(), baseMap::end()); }

Once this is done save your ls.h file and close the editor

Now you can install NS-2.35 in your system

Step 6 : Go inside ns-allinone-2.35 by using the command cd ns-allinone-2.35 from your terminal and enter the command ./install

Step 7 : As I am using Linux Mint, I need to paste the path in .profile file. Open .profile by entering the following command from your terminal

gedit .profile

Once the file is opened, you need to paste your path

export PATH=$PATH:/home/nabin/ns-allinone-2.35/bin:/home/nabin/ns-allinone-2.35/tcl8.5.10/unix:/home/nabin/ns-allinone-2.35/tk8.5.10/unix

Now save your file and close it

From your terminal run the following command to save your changes in the file

source .profile

The installation is over, now you need to check whether NS2 is working or not. Inorder to check type the following commands in your terminal
